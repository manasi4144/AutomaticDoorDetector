# Automatic Door Detector

Automate an entry/exit doorway to a customer site that senses customers automatically with programmable trigger levels for proximity. Design includes:

   - Outside Distance Proximity Sensors
   - Inside Distance Proximity Sensors
   - Door Position Limit Switches
   - Collision Switches 
   - Door Motor
   - LCD Display for user output
   - Switches, Pushbutton and keypad for user inputs
   - 3 operating modes 
   
**NOTE:** This is a complex program with a number of different files and folders to configure all the elements. The main snippet of the code(without all the drivers and supporting functions) is added to Github for a sample.
